# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 – My solutions


This repository contains my solutions to the daily challenges of **Advent of Code 2025**, an annual programming event created by [Eric Wastl](https://adventofcode.com/2025).


Every day from 1 to 25 December, a new puzzle divided into two parts is published, and in this repo I document my solutions, ideas and learning.
